<!-- The meta tag in HTML provides information about HTML Document or in simple words
These tags are basically used to add name/value pairs to describe properties of HTML document, 
such as expiry date, author name, list of keywords, document author, etc. 
This tag is an empty element because it only has an opening tag and no closing tag but it carries information within its attributes.
